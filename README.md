# Twitter Bots
This repository contains the soure code for all the twitter bots I have written. In general, these are all written in Python, utilize the public Twitter API, and are hosted on a Raspberry Pi. 

### Tweet The Weather As a Gif
The fun Twitter bot that reads the local forecast via OpenWeatherMap API, and tweets a gif related to that day's forecast. Don't get out of bed or switch apps; see the forecast right on your timeline in a fun way!

### Twitter Follow Tracker
Track the number of followers and detect if any were lost.

### Find Fake Followers
Identify fake and potentially malicious Instagram followers and block them automatically.
